## Project Description
This project is a budget tracker that allows users to set their total budget and add expenses 
tied to a category and it's amount. The website will digest that data and output a pie chart that
shows the percent spent in each category relative to their total budget. The user can also view all
of their expenses in a list that states the category and amount spent.
